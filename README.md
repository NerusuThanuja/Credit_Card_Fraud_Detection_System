# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_System
AI-based Credit Card Fraud Detection System using machine learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction, demonstrating end-to-end AI deployment in financial security.

## Dataset

This project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.  
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


## Features
- Detects fraudulent and legitimate credit card transactions
- Machine learning-based classification
- Real-time prediction using Streamlit web interface
- User-friendly input and result display

## How It Works
1. Transaction data is preprocessed and scaled.
2. A machine learning model is trained on historical transaction data.
3. User inputs transaction features through the Streamlit app.
4. The model predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `creditcard.csv` in the project folder.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   streamlit run app.py


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Project Motivation
Financial fraud is a major challenge in digital transactions. 
This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied 
to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and improve financial security.


## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with machine learning pipelines
- Learned data preprocessing and model training
- Built and deployed an interactive web app using Streamlit
- Understood real-world challenges like class imbalance and fraud detection
